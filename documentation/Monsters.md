### Mr. Sushi
Mr. sushi is an easy boss, which spawns when the ingredients "rice" and "fish" are combined.

Mr. Sushi has the following attacks:
- Rice projectile: shoots a rice towards the player along the X or Y axis. If the player is hit x damage is taken. This is the standard attack.
- Kelp string: shoots at string of kelp towards the player (can be diagonal?) if the player is hit, gets rooted for 1 second.
- Sushi Roll: Mr. sushi lies down and rolls toward the player along the X or Y axis, when Mr. Sushi is next to the player he will turn and roll along the other axis. Mr. Sushi will do three consecutive rolls, unless the player is hit, in which case x damage is inflicted, and the rolling stops.
